# Brute-Force-Java
This Program is a brute-force program to guess a password.
This program is first created to compare between the speed of brute-forcing in Java programming language and other programming languages.

## How To Use
To test a password, define the allowed characters, by modifying the `allowed_chars` attribute in the `StringGenerator` class, then change the `password` variable in the main class, and enter the password you want to test.
The maximum length of the password depends on another constant `MAX_LENGTH`
